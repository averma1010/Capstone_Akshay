## Abstract
This study delves into the evolution of online hate networks following significant real-world events, such as the 2020 U.S. presidential election and the January 6 Capitol attack. By analyzing hate speech themes and network topology, the research uncovers shifts in online hate dynamics, emphasizing the role of platforms like Telegram in propagating extremist ideologies.

## Using the Dashboard
