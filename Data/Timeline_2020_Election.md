For prior events, see [[Timeline of the 2020 United States presidential election (2017–2019)]] and [[Timeline of the 2020 United States presidential election (January–October 2020)]].

President [[Donald Trump]] of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], who was elected in [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]], was seeking reelection to a second term, against former vice president [[Joe Biden]] of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The general election was held on November 3, with voters directly selecting their state's members to the [[United States Electoral College|U.S. Electoral College]]. On November 7, most national media organizations projected that Biden had clinched enough electoral votes to be named the [[President-elect of the United States|U.S. president-elect]]. The formal voting by the Electoral College took place on December 14. The [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] then [[2021 United States Electoral College vote count|certified the electoral result]] on January 7, 2021, and Joe Biden was [[United States presidential inauguration|inaugurated]] on January 20, 2021.


== The invisible primary and debate period ==
{{See|Timeline of the 2020 United States presidential election (2017–2019)}}
The "[[invisible primary]]" is the first phase of any presidential contest, when hopefuls "test the waters" by forming PACS and "exploratory committees" in order to see if such an endeavor is worthwhile. This is followed by the formal announcement of candidacies, and a period of televised debates and other events prior to the beginning of delegate selection.

== The primary and general election campaigns ==
{{See|Timeline of the 2020 United States presidential election (January–October 2020)}}
There are three main parts to every election year. The primaries, where delegates to the party's quadrennial convention are selected, the conventions themselves, and the fall general election.
