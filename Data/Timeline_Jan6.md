==Attack on the Capitol==
At noon, Trump began an over one-hour speech encouraging protesters to march to the U.S. Capitol. At 12:49&nbsp;p.m., Capitol Police responded to reports of an explosive device, later identified as a [[pipe bomb]]. At 12:53&nbsp;p.m., nineteen minutes before Trump ended his speech, rioters overran the perimeter of the Capitol building, and at 2:06&nbsp;p.m. they entered the building through the Columbus Doors.

Trump's tweet requesting the crowd to "stay peaceful" is sent roughly half an hour later, at 2:38&nbsp;p.m. However, at 2:44&nbsp;p.m., a Capitol Police officer inside the Speaker's Lobby adjacent to the House chambers shot and fatally wounded rioter [[Ashli Babbitt]] as she climbed through a broken window of a barricaded door. Minutes later, Governor of Virginia [[Ralph Northam]] activated all available assets of the State of Virginia including the Virginia National Guard to aid the U.S. Capitol, although the Department of Defense still had not authorized it. By 3:15&nbsp;p.m., assets from Virginia began rolling into D.C.

An hour later, at 4:17 p.m, a video of Trump was uploaded to Twitter in which he instructed "you have to go home now". Fifteen minutes later, Secretary Miller authorized the D.C. National Guard to actually deploy.

==== Trump watches TV (1:25–4:03 p.m.) ====
According to the final report of the January 6 House select committee:<blockquote>"Here’s what President Trump did during the 187 minutes between the end of his speech and when he finally told rioters to go home: For hours, he watched the attack from his TV screen. His channel of choice was Fox News. He issued a few tweets, some on his own inclination and some only at the repeated behest of his daughter and other trusted advisors. He made several phone calls, some to his personal lawyer Rudolph Giuliani, some to Members of Congress about continuing their objections to the electoral certification, even though the attack was well underway.

Here’s what President Trump did not do: He did not call any relevant law enforcement agency to ensure they were working to quell the violence. He did not call the Secretary of Defense; he did not call the Attorney General; he did not call the Secretary of Homeland Security. And for hours on end, he refused the repeated requests—from nearly everyone who talked to him—to simply tell the mob to go home."<ref>{{Cite web |date=December 22, 2022 |title=Final report |url=https://january6th.house.gov/sites/democrats.january6th.house.gov/files/Report_FinalReport_Jan6SelectCommittee.pdf |access-date=December 23, 2022 |website=january6th.house.gov |pages=593–594}}</ref></blockquote>Trump's aides confirmed that he watched the television coverage,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Long |first=Colleen |date=2022-03-31 |title=Trump's 8-hour gap: Minute-by-minute during Jan. 6 riot |url=https://apnews.com/article/capitol-siege-elections-donald-trump-presidential-elections-election-2020-3315609c4152b4429930a17191b5a217 |access-date=2023-09-17 |website=[[Associated Press|AP News]] |language=en}}</ref> but Trump himself has refused to admit doing so.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Price |first=Michelle L. |date=2023-09-17 |title=Trump Refuses To Say How He Watched Jan. 6 Attack Unfold |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-refuses-to-say-how-he-watched-jan-6-attack-unfold_n_65073b29e4b0da755e7faeca |access-date=2023-09-17 |website=[[HuffPost]] |language=en}}</ref> Two months after the attack on the Capitol, he told journalist Jonathan Karl: "When I get back [to the White House], I saw—I wanted to go back [to the Capitol].

Piatt]], director of the Army Staff, noted that the Pentagon needed Capitol Police authorization to step onto Capitol grounds. Sund began describing the breach by rioters but the call became unintelligible as multiple people began asking questions at the same time. Metro Police Chief [[Robert Contee]] asked for clarification from Capitol Police Chief Sund: "Steve, are you requesting National Guard assistance at the Capitol?" to which Chief Sund replied, "I am making urgent, urgent, immediate request for National Guard assistance." According to Sund, Lt. Gen. Piatt said, "I don't like the visual of the National Guard standing a police line with the Capitol in the background", and that he prefer that the Guard relieve police posts around D.C. to allow police to deploy to the Capitol. Sund pleaded with Lt. Gen. Piatt to send the Guard, but Lt. Gen. Piatt said only Army Secretary McCarthy had the authority to approve such a request and he could not recommend that Secretary McCarthy approve the request for assistance directly to the Capitol. The D.C. officials were subsequently described as "flabbergasted" at this message. McCarthy would later state that he was not in this conference call because he was already entering a meeting with senior Department leadership.<ref name="WaPo_hamstrung" /> Piatt contests this description of the call, denying that he talked about visuals and stating that he stayed on the conference call while senior Defense Department officials were meeting.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Coleman |first1=Justine |title=Director of Army Staff disputes Capitol Police chief account of National Guard deployment |url=https://thehill.com/policy/defense/533747-director-of-army-staff-disputes-capitol-police-chief-account-of-national-guard |website=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |access-date=January 13, 2021 |language=en |date=January 11, 2021 |archive-date=January 13, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210113162021/https://thehill.com/policy/defense/533747-director-of-army-staff-disputes-capitol-police-chief-account-of-national-guard |url-status=live }}</ref> The Army falsely denied for two weeks that Lt.
